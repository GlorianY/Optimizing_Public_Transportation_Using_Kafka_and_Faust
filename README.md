# Optimizing Public Transportation Using Kafka and Faust
This repository contains my code in attempting to tackle the Udacity Data Streaming Nanodegree program.

The goal of the task is to develop a Kafka producer which emits system status for commuters in a streaming fashion. Another goal is, to develop a Faust-based consumer to consume the streamed commuter system status data.
